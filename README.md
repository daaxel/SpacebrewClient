# Spacebrew Client 0.2.1
This is a Java client API library for [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc/). Spacebrew allows flexible routing of simple messages between WebSocket based clients. Created by Axel Baumgartner for the [Center for Human-Computer Interaction, University of Salzburg, Austria](http://www.icts.sbg.ac.at).

Modified from [spacebrew-processing-library](https://github.com/Spacebrew/spacebrewP5) by [Brett Renfer and Julio Terra](http://rockwellgroup.com/lab).

## Features
* Reworked implementation from the original Spacebrew Processing library
* Tries to connect until the server is online
* Automatically reconnects on disconnect
* Notifies of connection status via log
* Exposes onOpen(), onClose() and onError() events
* Allows to add or remove publishers and subscribers while connected
* Allows to use publishers and subscribers with the same name but differing types
* Ensures that incoming range messages lie within the allowed interval of [0,1023]
* Offers another way to implement publishers by objects that extend abstract publishers
* Offers another way to implement subscribers by objects that implement the subscriber interfaces
* Offers an abstract range subscriber with simple low-pass filtering and linear transformation of input values

## Minimum Required JDK
* Java 1.6
* Android 1.6 (API 4)

## API Dependencies
* [java_websocket](http://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket)
* [json-simple-1.1.1](http://code.google.com/p/json-simple)
* [slf4j-api-1.7.2](http://www.slf4j.org)
* [slf4j-simple-1.7.2](http://www.slf4j.org) Required only if no other logger is used 

## Usage
For detailed examples please take a look at [src/test/java/Example.java](https://github.com/daaxel/SpacebrewClient/blob/master/src/test/java/Example.java). A most basic example class using the library may look like this:

```java

	import at.ac.sbg.icts.spacebrew.client.*;

	public class Example implements SpacebrewClientCallback
	{
		public void main(String[] args)
		{
			SpacebrewClient client = new SpacebrewClient(this, "ws://sandbox.spacebrew.cc:9000", "SpacebrewClient", "A simple Java client");
			client.connect();
			client.addPublisher("output", SpacebrewMessage.TYPE_STRING, "");
			client.publish("output", "Hello world!");
   			client.addSubscriber("input", SpacebrewMessage.TYPE_STRING, "receive");
		}
        
		public void receive(String message)
		{
			System.out.println("Received: " + message);
		}
        
		@override
		public void onOpen()
		{
			System.out.println("Connection to server opened.");
		}

		@override
		public void onError()
		{
			System.out.println("Error occurred.");
		}
        
		@override
		public void onClose()
		{
			System.out.println("Connection to server closed.");
		}
	}

```
## FAQ

* How can I change the value that a publisher is sending?
>Publishers only send data when you tell them to via the `publish()` method. Use `client.publish("output", "Hello world!");` to send the message `Hello world!` via the publisher `output`. If you 

* How can I change the name or type of a publisher?
>You canâ€™t change the name directly. You have to remove the publisher from the client and create a new publisher with the desired name or type. For example if you want to change the name and type of the `output` publisher from the above example use:
>
>```java
client.removePublisher("output", SpacebrewMessage.TYPE_STRING);
client.addPublisher("differentOutput", SpacebrewMessage.TYPE_RANGE);
```
* I am using an infinite loop (or game loop) in my program but don't want to connect and disconnect everytime the loop cycles. How do I keep the connection and only send data when necessary?
>Check out the detailed example [src/test/java/Example.java](https://github.com/daaxel/SpacebrewClient/blob/master/src/test/java/Example.java). The main class uses an infinite loop and demonstrates how the method calls of  `client.connect()` and `client.publish()` are separated.
* My code compiles, but while running the program I receive the following exception: ``"Could not pass incoming spacebrew message to callback, exception occurred 
while calling callback method for subscriber with name... "``
>This happens when your code in your `receive()` implementation throws an exception. Check the method you specified as callback. If you configure slf4j to use the DEBUG log level, you will be able to see the stack trace of the cause.
* How do I enable the DEBUG log level?
>If you use SimpleLogger you can do this simply by adding this line to the beginning of your main class:
>```java
System.setProperty(org.slf4j.impl.SimpleLogger.DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL_KEY, "DEBUG");
```
